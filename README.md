# ProjectWebSecurity
3rd Year Project

Program to monitor for unauthorised changes to a website.

Web pages are hashed and the hashes stored in a database. The program monitors the website, getting hashes of the pages. It then compares the hashes with those in the database and if there is no match, it sends an alert to the administrator.
